<b>Hello! I am Satvik Shrivastava. I designed this Facebook cover photo for OpenMRS.</b>

I kept it simple, conveying and with balancing color contrast. Accurate dimensions are followed. Logos used, are in their original ratios with original font as stated in OpenMRS's logo policy. I used a free stock image, link: https://www.pexels.com/photo/adult-aged-baby-care-226616/
and edited it in photoshop to make it blend with the cover.

<b> Here's a preview: </b> <img src = "https://github.com/satvikshri/OpenMRS-submissions/blob/master/FBcoverGsoc/FacebookCover.png">

FacebookCover.png is for preview.

FacebookCover.ai is the original illustrator file.

BackgroundIMG.png is the stock photo I used.

BackgroundIMG.psd has the edits in photoshop.

Feedback and suggestions are welcome. Hope you will like my work! :)

<b>Thank you!</b>

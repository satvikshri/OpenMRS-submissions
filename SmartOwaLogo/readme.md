<b> Hello, I'm Satvik Shrivastava. I designed this logo of Smart OWA for OpenMRS.</b>

task: 

<p>Since this logo will also be used in small area, be it in a navigation bar or inside any description, the logo should be well recognizable when dimensions are being reduced and represent the purpose of Smart OWA. To overcome these obstacles, I avoided making any isometric or detailed logo, yet tried a minimial one. </p>

The concept was to merge "Extraction"(extraction of resources from FHIR by smart apps) and "Deployment"(deployment of smart apps to OpenMRS by Smart OWA). I drew elements which could represent both these concept.

I made two variations. 

logo.png and logomonochromatic.png are the logos.

design. ai is the original design file.

Hope you will like my work!

<b>Thank you! </b>

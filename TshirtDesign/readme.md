<b> Hello! I'm Satvik Shrivastava. I designed this T-shirt for OpenMRS. </b>

Task: https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/6509112721408000/

<p> I kept it simple. I designed the T-shirt in CMYK color format for priniting purpose. I used few colors to avoid making the printing expensive, however minimial. </P

<b> Here are 2 previews: </b>

Feedback and suggestions are welcome. Hope you will like my work!

<b>Thank you!</b>

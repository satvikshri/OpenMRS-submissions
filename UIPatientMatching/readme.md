<b>Hello! I'm Satvik Shrivastava. I designed this new UI of Patient Matching for OpenMRS.</b>

Task: https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/6651153208049664/

I designed this UI in Adobe Illustrator. Of course, colours, fonts can be configured as I have uploaded the source file too.

<b>Current UI:</b>

<b>Proposed:</b>

<ul>
  <b>Improvements:</b>
  <li>More systematic UI.</li>
  <li> More clarity and more lucid environment.</li>
  <li>Better use of spaces and more user friendly.</li>
 </ul> 
 
 design.ai is the original source file.
 
 uifinal.jpg is for preview.
 
 Hope you will like my work!
 
 <b>Thank you!</b>

<b>Hello! I am Satvik Shrivastava. I designed this Facebook cover photo for OpenMRS's Volunteer of the Month.</b>

Task: https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/5182076744630272/

I kept it simple, conveying and with balancing color contrast. Accurate dimensions are followed. Logos used, are in their original ratios with original font as stated in OpenMRS's logo policy. I used a free stock image,

and edited it in photoshop to make it blend with the cover. I followed the similar theme which I followed for my other two designs of Facebook Cover for OpenMRS.

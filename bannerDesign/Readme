 Hello! I am Satvik Shrivastava. I designed this banner for OpenMRS.

Task: https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/6388320088096768/

I kept it simple, conveying and with balancing color contrasts. I included elements like health care, technology, open source in either graphical or text base. Logos used, are in their original ratios with original font as stated in OpenMRS's logo policy. I used a free stock image, link:

and edited it in photoshop to make it blend with the banner.

preview.jpg is for preview. (gray background isn't part of the poster)
banner.ai is the original illustrator file.
background.png is the stock photos I used.
Background.psd has the edits in photoshop.

Feedback and suggestions are welcome. Hope you will like my work! :)

Thank you! </p>

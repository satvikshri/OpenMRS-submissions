<b>Hello! I am Satvik Shrivastava. I designed this banner for OpenMRS.</b>

Task: https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/6388320088096768/

<p>I kept it simple, conveying and with balancing color contrasts. I included elements like health care, technology, open source in either graphical or text base. Logos used, are in their original ratios with original font as stated in OpenMRS's logo policy. I used a free stock image, link: </p>

and edited it in photoshop to make it blend with the banner.

<b> Here's a preview: <img src="https://github.com/satvikshri/OpenMRS-submissions/blob/master/bannerDesign/preview.jpg"> </b>

preview.jpg is for preview. (gray background isn't part of the banner)

banner.ai is the original illustrator file.

background.png is the stock photos I used.

Background1.psd has the edits in photoshop.

Feedback and suggestions are welcome. Hope you will like my work! :)

<b> Thank you!</b>

<b>Hello! I'm Satvik. I designed this error 404 page for OpenMRS.</b>

You can preview it here: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/satvikshri/OpenMRS-submissions/blob/master/error404page/index.html

Task: https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/4588682129440768/

I designed the page in HTML. The links redirects to their corresponding pages and the OpnMRS logo at the bottom redirects to the OpenMRS's website. I made it simple. It doesn't have any large sized element and hence it opens quickly. The page is responsive so that it could be accessed via phones too.

<b>Here's a preview of me using it:</b>

Index.html is the original code file.
preview.jpg an gif.gif are for preview purpose and rest are the images are used in the HTML.

Hope you will like my work! 

<b>Thank you!</b>

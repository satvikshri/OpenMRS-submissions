<b>Hello! I'm Satvik Shrivastava.</b>
I designed this UI for Home Page of GCI Site. I have presented the design in pdf format to get a clear vision of the site and have also attached a mini-preview in jpeg format. 

This site will look even better with parallax effect in the background image, typewriter effect in heading, css objects, hover effects and line transition animations when rendered into a complete site.
